Code for skimming and slimming CAF Ntuples.  For VBS W(lnu)V(jj)jj 8 TeV analysis.

Note: I don't use this code to submit grid jobs anymore.

To use:
make
./SkimSlimLvqqNtuple 1 <dsID> <systname="Nominal">    #1 for MC, 0 for data

You need to have a list of CAF files to be slimmed in a txt file called "input."+dsId+"."+syst+".txt"

Modified code based on code from Higgs group
