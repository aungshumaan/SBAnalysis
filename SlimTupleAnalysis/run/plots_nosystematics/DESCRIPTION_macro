plotMakerHww.C
plotOne.C : basic plotting from a hwwlvqq root file
syst_JER_BaseJES.C : Comparing JER, JESUp and JESDown with Nominal distribution
print_events2.C : Directly read information from slimntuples. later version of print_events.C
cutflow_CAF.C : Prints out SMWZ and Common CAF cutflow. Need to run like "root -l -b -q cutflow_CAF.C+" (uncompiled code crashes)
cutflow_CAF2.C : Use this code for CAF cutflows. Modified version of cutflow_CAF.C. Need to run like "root -l -b -q cutflow_CAF.C+" (uncompiled code crashes). 
cutflow_CAF_blah.C : Modified version of cutflow_CAF.C. Counts number of empty CAF files.
cutflow_CAFSlim.C : Quickly compare CAF output and slim input
cutflow.C : Quickly print out cutflows if you don't want to use interCutFlow.C
syst_all.C : DEPRECATED. produces syst vs nominal plots. Stores it into syst_comparison directory.Error on ratio is wrong. Use sys_response3.C instead.
alpgenWjetsStudy.C : Study Alpgen NP samples. Get stat error for different slices.
stackPlotWithSignal.C : stack plot with signal overlaid. I am using a different macro because it feels cleaner this way and I don't have to edit the usual data-MC comparison stack plots.
syst_response_commonEvents.C : This was for testing. Looked at the common events to see if Up and Down syst comtribution is symmentric.
syst_response2.C : Reads ratio...root files, so error bars will be correct on the ratio of syst to Nominal. Compares Up against Down type syst. 
syst_response2.1.C : Reads histograms from hwwlvqq files. So error bars will be wrong on the ratio of syst to Nominal. But often we are only interested in the ratio but not on the error on the ratio, and this macro does enough in that case. Otherwise very similar to syst_response2.C as it also compares Up against Down syst. 
syst_response.C : Just Up type systematic response. Compare one at a time against Nominal.
syst_response3.C :[ DEPRECATED. Use syst_response4.C.] Up type systematic response. Compare upto eight at a time against Nominal.
syst_response4.C : Similar to syst_response3.C i.e. compares upto eight systematics at a time against Nominal. Reads ratio...root files, so error bars will be correct on the ratio of syst to Nominal.
syst_response4.1.C : Similar to syst_response4.C, but plots only systematic/Nominal ratio
syst_response5.1.C : Unlike syst_response4.1.C, calculates ratio histograms from Nominal, syst, both etc histograms instead of reading it directly from ratio...root files.
syst_response5.1_merge.C : Similar to syst_response5.1.C. Merges all fouur channels. Can plot variable bin histogram for mTWV. Calculates ratio histograms from Nominal, syst, both etc histograms instead of reading it directly from ratio...roo
blah2.C
stackPlotNoQCD.C :
stackPlotNoQCD_extrapolation.C : fake region stack plot, shows ptwlep distribution  
blah.C
stackPlotWithQCD.C
sherpaAlp.C : Used for quickly compare two distributions with their ratio in the bottom panel (which assumes uncorrelated distributions).
sherpaAlp2.C : Instead of comparing just two samples, it compares a sample against bkg subtracted Data. Also gets the goodness of fit.
sherpaAlp_tmp.C : code compares Sherpa and Alpgen. Error band is calculated by varying renormalization-factrization and CKKW scale in SHERPA
sherpaAlp_resolve.C : code compares Sherpa and Alpgen variable bin mTWV distributions. This code is for resolved region where electron and muon merged together but positive and negative kept separate.
sherpaAlp_fat.C : code compares Sherpa and Alpgen variable bin mTWV distributions. fat region where electron, positron, muon and anti-muon merged together.

syst_band.C : plots Data-MC and their ratio and then adds the systematic band to the ratio plot.

getHighestDeviationForSyst.h : The function loops over histogram bins and calculate the relative deviation from the nominal due to a systematic source. It prints out the maximum deviation.
